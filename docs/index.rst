NiaAML's documentation!
==================================

.. automodule:: niaaml

NiaAML is an automated machine learning Python framework based on nature-inspired algorithms for optimization. The name comes from the automated machine learning method of the same name [1]. Its goal is to efficiently compose the best possible classification pipeline for the given task using components on the input. The components are divided into three groups: feature seletion algorithms, feature transformation algorithms and classifiers. The framework uses nature-inspired algorithms for optimization to choose the best set of components for the classification pipeline on the output and optimize their parameters. We use NiaPy framework for the optimization process which is a popular Python collection of nature-inspired algorithms. The NiaAML framework is easy to use and customize or expand to suit your needs.
