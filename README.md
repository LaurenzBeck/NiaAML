# NiaAML

NiaAML is an automated machine learning Python framework based on nature-inspired algorithms for optimization. The name comes from the automated machine learning method of the same name [[1]](#1). It's goal is to efficiently compose the best possible classification pipeline for the given task using components on the input. The components are divided into three groups: feature preprocessing algorithms, feature selection algorithms and classifiers. The framework uses nature-inspired algorithms for optimization to choose the best set of components for the classification pipeline on the output and optimize their parameters. We use <a href="https://github.com/NiaOrg/NiaPy">NiaPy framework</a> for the optimization process which is a popular Python collection of nature-inspired algorithms.
